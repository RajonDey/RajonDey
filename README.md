# Rajon Dey

Senior Software Engineer and Module Lead (Frontend) with a strong focus on building
scalable, production-grade web applications.

I work primarily with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, owning frontend architecture
and delivery for enterprise, healthcare, and SaaS products at SJ Innovation LLC.
Alongside frontend leadership, I’m working on a full-stack experience by building
backend services with Node.js and Python (FastAPI), and working with PostgreSQL and
modern deployment workflows.

I value clean code, maintainable architecture, and long-term product thinking over
short-term solutions or hype.
